# Eukaryotyping: an ensemble similarity-based classification algorithm   

This method constitutes a type of unsupervised [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and was developed to address three issues:

 1. The common occurrence of missing data in genotyping datasets (e.g. such as a situation where 2 or 3 out of 6 multi-locus sequence typing fail to amplify for a subset of your specimens).

 2. The use of MLST methods in the context of sexually reproducing populations, where even closely related individuals may not possess the same genotype (and may be heterozygous) due to chromosomal crossover and random reassortment of chromosomes as occurs during meiosis.

 3. The issue of analyzing specimens which may be extremely complex, potentially representing mixed populations of individuals. Ever try to construct a phylogeny or generate a cluster dendrogram in a situation where for one MLST marker you detect one haplotype, at another you detect three, at another you detect four and another you detect two - in the same specimen? This is essentially what we deal with when we attempt to genotype *Cyclospora cayetanensis* directly     from human stool. It gets extremely complicated.

_Please cite the following [manuscript](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/genotyping-genetically-heterogeneous-cyclospora-cayetanensis-infections-to-complement-epidemiological-case-linkage/0C51FBFFB172DF50357C1D171E9B8657) if you end up using the described Eukaryotyping haplotype caller in your work:_

## Getting Started

>These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

The haplotype caller was developed and tested using a Mac running OSX Catalina 10.15.3. Subsequent instructions are provided _only_ for installing it on an OSX system.

First create a local copy of this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:Joel-Barratt/Eukaryotyping.git` 



### Prerequisites for OSX Catalina

>What prerequisites you need to install the haplotype caller

#### Xcode Command Line Tools

Install Xcode

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Check it installed in your $PATH (e.g., /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

#### Local R package

Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), download and install `R-3.6.3.pkg (notarized, for Catalina)`

Check that R installed

```bash
R -h   # you should get a help print out with options for R  
```

### Running the haplotype caller

>While in the folder with all the files from the cloned Eukaryotyping github run:

```bash
Rscript run.r
```
> This will run about 100 samples and produce matrices which can be used for further downstream analysis
